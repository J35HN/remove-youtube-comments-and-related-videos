# remove-youtube-comments-and-related-videos
A Chrome Extension that removes comments and related videos to a video from YouTube with a CSS insertion.

# Overview
This extension disables comments and related videos on a YouTube video. The intention is to have a minimalist and distraction-free experience while watching a video that is not in fullscreen. When toggled to ``ON``, this extension injects a CSS file to a video page, adding/changing the ``display`` style to ``none``, to the elements of ``#comments`` and ``#secondary-inner``. When toggled ``OFF``, it removes this CSS file.
